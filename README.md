# Bike-Sales-Dashboard
From Pivot Tables to Powerful Insights â€“ My First Excel Dashboard!

Overview:
This project is a comprehensive Excel dashboard built to analyze and visualize key insights from a fictional bike sales dataset. The dashboard focuses on demographic and behavioral attributes of customers to understand patterns in bike purchasing behavior.
It was created to demonstrate proficiency in data analysis, pivot tables, slicers, and dynamic charting using Excel â€” an essential skill for any aspiring data analyst or business intelligence professional.
